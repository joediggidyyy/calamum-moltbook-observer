# Public Run Ledger

This ledger defines the current public reporting population and provides a runtime-safe census of the tracked report family.

## Purpose

- Count what currently exists in the tracked report family.
- Keep the reader-facing population separate from the machine-authoritative run ledger.
- Route readers to synthesis and packet-entry surfaces without pretending this ledger is the authority plane.

## How to read this ledger

- Use `AGGREGATE_REPORT.md` for the flagship synthesis narrative.
- Use `LATEST_COLLECTIONS.md` when you need the fastest packet-entry route.
- Use `WORKFLOW_ROLLUP.md` and `THRESHOLD_SUMMARY.md` when you need family-specific rollups.

## Current runtime-safe headline

- Publish root: `docs/reports`
- Published runs: 0
- Collection aliases represented: 0
- Workflow families represented: 0
- Threshold-bearing packets: 0

## Current lane census

No workflow families are published yet.

## Publication-family census

No collection packets are published yet.

## Interpretive notes

- This ledger is deliberately derived and runtime-safe; it summarizes the tracked publication family without replacing the canonical machine-readable run records.
- Absence here means the packet did not enter the tracked publication family; it does not imply the underlying machine artifacts do not exist.

## Provenance

- Machine-readable authority remains outside `docs/reports/`.
- The tracked report family is rebuilt from the canonical untracked DS run spine and packetized collection surfaces.
